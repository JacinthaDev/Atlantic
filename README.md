# My Awesome Project
This is my mock-up version of the Atlancic newspaper website. I flexed my knowledge of CSS and layout to create this project.

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS

I put to use my knowledge of semantic HTML & CSS. CSS was the real challenge here, as I dove deep into the box model and layout and learned how different elements behave together. Using flexbox could have been an easier way to design this mockup, but floats really provided me with an intimate understanding of web design.

## Lessons Learned:
This was my one of my first projects practicing CSS layout. It was harder for me than the Boston mockup I did since I struggle to figure out how to section my page and float in the most efficient way. This project took many hours to complete, but I learned so much by trial and error.

### Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
